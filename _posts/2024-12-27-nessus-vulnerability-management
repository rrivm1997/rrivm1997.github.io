# Nessus Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management is the process of identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and network systems. The goal is to reduce the risk of exploitation by proactively addressing vulnerabilities, through techniques such as patching, system updates, configuration changes, and other security measures to protect against potential attacks.


# Scenario

- Install Nessus Essentials.
- Install our virtual machine.
- Instead of installing up to date Windowns OS, install old-deprectaed software on it.
- Perform vulnerability scans.
- Remediate vulnerabilities.

# Home Lab

## Installing Nessus Essential

Visiting the official website (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus) I am going to download the software.

# Grabbing IP Address

On the virtual machine created, I will open up command prompt and type ipconfig and I will grab the IPv4 address to start a basic scan on Nessus.

# Creating The Scan

I will be doing a basic scan just for testing purposes.

- Create new scan.
- Basic Network Scan.

- Choose name.
- Add target.

I am doing a basic scan at the moment but Nessus allows to schedule a scan base on needs.

I am scanning common ports.

Save the scan.

# Scanning

I am going to start the scan,

# Viewing Results

Here I can see the type of vulnerabilities that the scan found.

Now I am going to do a credentialed scan and remidiate some vulnerabilities.
