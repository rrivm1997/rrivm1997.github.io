# The Open System Interconnection (OSI) Model

It is a standard for network protocols that describes how network devices communicate with each other across a network.

## OSI MODEL LAYERS

### Physical Layer

- This layer is responsible for the transmission of physical signals through transmission media such as cables and optical fibers. It identifies devices like hubs and transmission media like network cables.

- Some of the protocols operating at this layer include Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.

### Data Link Layer

- This layer ensures that the previously transmitted packets are correct and controls the flow of data packets being sent.

### Network Layer

- This layer handles logical addressing and the routing of data across the network. It includes source and destination IP addresses and determines the best route for sending packets.

- Protocols operating at this layer include IP, ICMP, OSPF, BGP, and RIP.

### Transport Layer

- This layer provides end-to-end transport services for data exchange between final devices.

- It ensures the proper sending and receiving of packets. Protocols such as UDP and TCP operate at this layer.

- Protocols operating at this layer include TCP, UDP, SCTP, and DCCP.

### Session Layer 

- This layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between hosts.

- Protocols operating at this layer include NetBIOS, PPTP, and SMB.

### Presentation Layer

- This layer handles data presentation to ensure it is understandable by receiving applications.

- Protocols operating at this layer include JPEG, MPEG, SSL/TLS, and ASCII.

### Application Layer

- This layer provides network services to end-user applications such as email and web browsing.

- Protocols at this layer include FTP, HTTP, SMTP, DNS, and SNMP.
